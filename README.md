## Setup/Installation Requirements
The current project creates a website app. Therefore, the requirements for successful hosting of the website include domain name, hosting provider, and finally hosting plan. There are no additional codes, databases, or servers for the current website because the webpage does not collect data or customer details. The primary purpose of the website is to provide information for customers to make informed decision and contact the agents via the available contacts and addresses.
## Known Bugs
Currently, there are no known bugs. However, sometimes the webpage may take time to load the images or fail to load them completely. Refreshing the page and using stronger networks are potential solutions.  
## Technologies Used
The main technology tools used to create the current web app include HTML version 5 and CSS. CSS was used to give the images a special visual appearance that is appealing to the eyes.
## Support and contact details
The current web app is still a work in progress. Should you encounter issues other than the ones mentioned previously in this readme, feel free to contact me. You may also help to develop the code further to improve the web app.
